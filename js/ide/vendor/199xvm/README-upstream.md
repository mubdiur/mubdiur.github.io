# 199xVM

A minimal Java bytecode interpreter compiled to WebAssembly, with an in-browser Java compiler.

## Concept

**"Write, compile, and run Java in the browser - no server required."**

199xVM consists of two parts:

1. **JVM interpreter** - Rust compiled to WebAssembly, interprets `.class` bytecode directly
2. **Java compiler** - TypeScript compiler that emits `.class` bytecode in the browser

No transpilation and no server round-trip. Java source is compiled and executed fully client-side.

## Scope and claim

199xVM targets **progressive Java 25 compatibility** for practical in-browser execution.

It is **not** a full implementation of `javac` or HotSpot, and it should not currently be advertised as "fully JLS/JVMS compliant". The conformance matrix below is the source of truth for implementation status.

## JLS/JVMS conformance matrix

Status labels:

- **Implemented**: feature is broadly available in this project scope
- **Partial**: significant subset works, but edge cases or strict checks are incomplete
- **Limited**: intentionally narrow support

### How to maintain this matrix

- Add or update a row whenever language/runtime behavior changes.
- Keep each row tied to concrete evidence (`tests` or implementation path).
- If a row is Partial/Limited, keep `Gap / next step` actionable.

### JLS (Java Language Specification) matrix

| ID | Topic | Status | Evidence | Gap / next step |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| JLS-3 | Lexical structure / tokens / literals | Implemented | `lexer.ts` + lexer tests | Keep parity checks for edge lexical forms |
| JLS-6 | Names, scope, and shadowing | Partial | `compiler.ts` scope/shadowing diagnostics + tests | Effectively-final: enclosing-scope reassignment not yet checked |
| JLS-8 | Classes, members, constructors (incl. records/enums) | Partial | parser+codegen tests | Cover remaining declaration constraints and corner cases |
| JLS-9 | Interfaces and inheritance behavior | Partial | method resolution tests | Expand default/static/interface conflict rules |
| JLS-11 | Exceptions and checked-exception analysis | Partial | throw/catch analysis tests | Expand full-path exception typing coverage |
| JLS-14 | Statements (`if/for/while/switch/try/assert/synchronized`) | Partial | parser/codegen/runtime tests | Continue strict semantic checks and flow diagnostics |
| JLS-15 | Expressions, calls, conversions, lambdas | Partial | expression codegen tests | Close gaps in typing/narrowing/inference edge cases |
| JLS-16 | Definite assignment | Limited | basic flow checks | Add full DA/DU data-flow analysis equivalent to `javac` |
| JLS-7 / JLS-13 | Packages/imports and binary compatibility | Partial | import resolution tests | Improve compatibility checks and diagnostics |
| JLS tooling areas | Modules, annotation processing, full toolchain parity | Limited | out of current scope | Track as separate long-term epics |

### JVMS (Java Virtual Machine Specification) matrix

| ID | Topic | Status | Evidence | Gap / next step |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| JVMS-4 | ClassFile format and constant pool | Implemented | `class_file.rs` + parser tests | Add stricter validation where parser is permissive |
| JVMS-5 | Linking/loading behavior (project scope) | Implemented | ClassLoader hierarchy (ClassLoader → SecureClassLoader → URLClassLoader), JAR loader, `defineClass`, linkage error tests | Bytecode verifier (§4.10), multi-classloader namespace |
| JVMS-6 | Instruction set execution | Implemented | `dispatch.rs` + integration tests | Keep expanding opcode edge-case tests |
| JVMS-6.5 | Invocation (`invoke*`, `invokedynamic`) | Implemented | `invoke.rs`/`dispatch.rs` + invoke tests | No CallSite caching; bootstrap support is intentionally narrow |
| JVMS exceptions | Exception table dispatch / `athrow` | Implemented | runtime exception tests | Add more mixed `finally`/rethrow regressions |
| JVMS verification | Bytecode verifier strictness | Limited | runtime checks only | Implement stricter verifier-like prechecks |
| JVMS monitors/threads | Monitors + green threads (`Thread.start/join/yield`, `wait/notify/notifyAll`) | Partial | monitor/thread integration tests | Cooperative scheduler only (not OS/preemptive threads); timed wait/join/sleep and interruption semantics are intentionally limited |
| JVMS memory model | GC / object lifecycle behavior | Limited | `heap.rs` (ref-count) | No cycle collector; keep scope explicit |

## JAR loader

199xVM can load classes directly from JAR files at runtime via `Vm::load_jar()`. The Rust `zip` crate (WASM-compatible) handles ZIP decompression. Non-class resources in JARs are stored in a resource map and accessible via `ClassLoader.getResourceAsStream()`.

The frontend also exposes a `jar_to_bundle()` WASM export that converts JAR bytes to the flat bundle format, falling back to the JS-side `readJar()` when WASM is not available.

## JVM language support

199xVM supports running JVM languages beyond Java. **Clojure 1.12.0** has been validated via an AOT-compiled smoke test:

```sh
# Build the Clojure smoke test (requires clojure CLI)
./build-clj-smoke.sh

# Run it
make clj-smoke-test
```

The smoke test AOT-compiles a minimal Clojure program, loads it via the JAR loader alongside the Clojure runtime JARs, and verifies that `ClojureSmokeEntry.run()` returns `"ok"`.

This is an isolated diagnostic path — it is **not** part of `make test` or `cargo test`.

## JDK shim policy

JDK APIs are provided primarily as **pure Java shims** under `jdk-shim/` and compiled to bytecode.

- Target is Java 25 API compatibility where practical
- Prefer Java shim implementations over Rust native stubs
- Keep Rust natives only for runtime-boundary functionality (for example output/time/string bridging)

## Quick start

```sh
# 1) Build wasm VM
cargo install wasm-pack
wasm-pack build jvm-core --target web

# 2) Build JDK shims
./build-shim.sh

# 3) Build compiler
npm install
npm run build:javac

# 4) Serve
npx serve .
# open http://localhost:3000/web/
```

## Development

```sh
# Compiler tests
npm test                    # or: make test

# VM integration tests (42 fast tests, ~0.1s)
cargo test --package jvm-core

# Clojure smoke test (separate, ~44s)
make clj-smoke-test

# Rebuild core artifacts
./build-shim.sh
npm run build:javac
wasm-pack build jvm-core --target web
```

### Docker (three ways: VM only / Compiler only / Web Playground)

Use Docker or OrbStack with the project’s `docker-compose.yml`. Only the **web** service is started by `docker-compose up`; the **rust**, **java**, and **node** services are for one-off builds/tests via `docker-compose run <service> ...`.

**1. VM (wasm) only**

```sh
docker-compose run rust make wasm
docker-compose run rust cargo test --package jvm-core --lib
```

The `--lib` flag runs only unit tests. For full integration tests (which need `test-classes/bundle.bin`), build the test bundle first:  
`docker-compose run node npm ci && docker-compose run node make javac`, then `docker-compose run java make test-bundle`. After that, `docker-compose run rust cargo test --package jvm-core` runs all tests.

**2. Compiler only**

```sh
docker-compose run node npm ci   # first time (or when package.json changes)
docker-compose run node make javac
docker-compose run node make test
```

**3. Web Playground (full dist + serve)**

Build all artifacts, then start the web server:

```sh
docker-compose run java make dev-jars
docker-compose run rust make wasm
docker-compose run java make shim
docker-compose run node make javac
docker-compose run node make dist
docker-compose up   # serves dist/ at <http://localhost:3000/>
```

Then open <http://localhost:3000/>. Alternatively, use `make docker-playground` to run the build steps above and then `docker-compose up`.

> **Note:** `docker-compose up` (web service) serves `dist/`. Run `dist-docker` or the manual steps above before starting it, otherwise `dist/` will be empty.

## Known limitations (high level)

- Full Java 25 language/toolchain parity is out of scope today
- Full JVM verification and GC semantics are not implemented
- Threading is cooperative green-thread based (not full HotSpot/OS-thread parity)
- Some advanced language semantics are intentionally staged and tightened incrementally
